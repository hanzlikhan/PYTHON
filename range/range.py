# range is imp when we use loop 
# range(5)   here start is by default 0 end is 5 and step or inc is 1 by default 
# use 
# print(range(0)) 
# print(range(2)) 
# print(range(3)) 
seq = range(10)
# for i in seq:
#     print(i)
# range(2,5)  here start is 2 and the end is 5

# usually 
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# three ways to write range 
for i in range(2,10):
    print(i)

for i in range(100,0,-1):
    print(i)
